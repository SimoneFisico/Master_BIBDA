# In Verbis Virtus - Analytics

## Project Description

In Verbis Virtus is a fantasy-themed video game developed by the independent production company Indomitus (formerly Indomitus Games) and published in 2015 and still present on the Steam store.  
This project was born from a real need to explore the data recorded over almost 10 years to verify the scope of information contained in them.â€¨The recorded data are logs from actual game sessions played by users.
